Balinese believe that body, mind and spirit work in harmony. Health and well being leads to happiness. Our massages have healing power, releasing tension, freeing tissues of toxins and improving circulation.

Reflexology Foot Massage at our SPA relieves stress from areas in the feet that are in harmony with other areas of the body and increases the rejuvenating and revitalizing powers of the whole being.

Herbal, lemon, and ginger teas are natural medicines. They relax or stimulate, soothe and energize, rejuvenate and revitalize. At Bali Orchid SPA we offer the true Balinese hospitality and focus on the well being of our guests in a beautiful garden setting.
