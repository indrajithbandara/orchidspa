Shirodara is a traditional Indian treatment used to create relaxation and serenity. It begins with a soothing foot, neck and head massage during which attention is given to the energy points located on the head. Then a gentle stream of warm medicated oils is poured continually down over your chakra, the energy focus in the centre of your forehead to bring peace and clarity to your mind, body and spirit. It's recommended for the release of headaches, insomnia, stress and tension.
